# **Hospital Management System: Data Analysis and Visualization**

## **Overview**  
This is an ongoing group project focused on performing **data analysis** and **visualization** for a Hospital Management System. The project aims to analyze patient data, resource allocation, and operational efficiency to provide actionable insights that enhance hospital performance and decision-making.  

As the team lead, I oversee the data preparation, analysis, and visualization processes, leveraging Python and libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to work with complex healthcare data.  

---

## **Project Goals**  
- Perform detailed **data analysis** to uncover insights about patient demographics, resource utilization, and operational efficiency.  
- Develop **interactive visualizations** to aid in data-driven decision-making.  
- Ensure that insights can help optimize resource allocation, patient care, and cost-effectiveness.

---

## **Current Progress**  
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Simulated initial dataset containing patient information (age, gender, department, cost, etc.).  
   - Cleaned and structured data for analysis.  

2. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Calculated average costs by department.  
   - Identified patterns in gender distribution and resource utilization.  
   - Grouped data by age range to analyze hospital stay trends.  

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Created bar charts, pie charts, and other visualizations to represent key insights (e.g., cost per department, gender breakdown, age group trends).

## **Technologies and Tools**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis  
  - `matplotlib`: Basic data visualization  
  - `seaborn`: Advanced visualization and insights  

---

## **Features**  
- **Patient Data Analysis**:  
  - Trends in demographics (age, gender, etc.)  
  - Department-wise cost and efficiency metrics  

- **Resource Utilization**:  
  - Average days admitted based on age and condition  
  - Insights into cost optimization and better allocation  

- **Operational Efficiency**:  
  - Delivery of actionable insights to improve hospital workflows

## **Key Visualizations**  
### 1. **Average Cost by Department**  
Visualizes how costs vary across hospital departments to identify high-expense areas.  

### 2. **Gender Distribution**  
Shows gender-based trends in hospital admissions for better demographic understanding.  

### 3. **Age Group Trends**  
Highlights age-wise differences in the average length of stay and resource use.
